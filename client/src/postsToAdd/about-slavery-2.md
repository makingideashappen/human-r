### Anna Letitia Barbauld, ‘Epistle to William Wilberforce, Esq. On the Rejection of the Bill for Abolishing the Slave Trade’.

Wrung Nature’s tortures, shuddering, while you tell,
From scoffing fiends bursts forth the laugh of hell;
In Britain’s senate, Misery’s pangs give birth
To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth—
Forbear!—thy virtues but provoke our doom,
And swell th’ account of vengeance yet to come;
For, not unmarked in Heaven’s impartial plan,
Shall man, proud worm, contemn his fellow-man?

Written in 1791 after Wilberforce and the British abolitionists had been defeated in parliament, this poem responds to the impassioned (but failed) speeches of Wilberforce and others before turning to the corrupting influence of the slave trade.
