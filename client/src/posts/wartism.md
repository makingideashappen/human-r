## What is the problem

The wartism system is often aggressive or passive-aggressive and aims for territorial expansion, not to protect civilians. This is only a short summary of free thoughts on a subject.

## Introduction

What is Wartism? Wartism is a new term for political and economic situations that can be observed worldwide. It might be a military regime mistreating citizens where the military is a top priority. Stimulate trauma, for example, “kill or you be killed” among society, create enemies of the nation, and arm people one could describe. Sometimes, it can be military people together with the government trying to set laws, organizing socio-technical environments, or “bad whispering." This can cripple society by brainwashing and making people feel in constant danger and monetary poverty. Why? Very often to sustain government in power. In this regime, there might be a lack of economic freedom; the economy is centrally planned, and human rights are violated. What is horrible, but often seen today, is that religious extremism and militarism radicals are forcing to amplify society’s control and divisions. In Wartism, it is told that each world ending with “izm” is schizm, and “izm” has been introduced to separate and divide people.

## Other side of the coin

On the other side, country defense, anti-terror, and rescue missions are crucial. The military career can be good; it can be a source of income for many but also pride and knowledge. The military is also important to protect businesses and internals of the country during crises like COVID or natural disasters. For children scouting without weapons. Good leaders should professionalize the army with recruitment and training. Also, military advisors, modern equipment, and training programs to be up-to-date in the case and not be overpowered by, for example, terrorists. Last but not least, centralizing the army to reduce the possible power of regional warlords ensured the loyalty of the military.

## Sparta myth

In the ancient world, to be exact, in ancient Greece, Sparta could be a precursor of the wartism system. Small children were also treated harshly to live on the street and learn survival for their toughness and began military training at the age of seven. Wikipedia: Spartan men remained in the active reserve until age 60. Men were encouraged to marry at age 20 but could not live with their families until they left their active military service at age 30’. According to Aristotele, Spartans often focused on the military and were lacking in education compared to their neighborhoods. There is also a colloquialism for it: “Spartan upbringing. Despite its fame and territorial success, Sparta finally lost its prime due to the war population decrease.

## Short economy and politics aspect

The wartism economy suffers from corruption and exploitation of the existing economy. Lack of economic freedom leads to unemployment, not many new businesses, and is not attractive to investments. The best employer is a state, and a military career is promoted as a success in life. People who are in the military are divided into at least two groups: a rich and secure and cheap labor force that is living above poverty in their country. Moreover, there can be something like a “war tax” imposed either on citizens or businesses. For agriculture, the focus is on self-sufficiency. Of course, the production sector is fueling the war machine, weapons, and machinery needed. Politicians are militants or former militants that are controlled by military forces. Often they are seen with weapons and pose for pictures with them to protect their persona. There is also a problem with monetary policy because this system is not efficient and national money is too weak. With the increase of autism notable is an increase of human trafficking and a sudden increase in case of war burst, which means sexual and labor exploitation in a fast environment with promises for better, unfortunately where there is extra pressure standards are extremely low.

## Examples of countries suffering military regimes

Ukraine: Due to ongoing conflict, Ukraine leads with approximately 36.65% of its GDP dedicated to military spending. Oman: A significant portion of its budget goes to defense, spending around 5.17% of GDP. Jordan: Military expenditure amounts to about 4.84% of its GDP. Azerbaijan: Its military budget makes up around 4.55% of GDP. Saudi Arabia: As a major military power in the Middle East, it allocates around 7.4% of GDP to defense.”

Ukraine is due to a Russia-supported Donetsk separatist versus Ukraine conflict that started in 2015 and burst around 2022. In 2024, they are already worn out. It was mainly because of the population differences, where Russians were 17% of all people and voted for separation. No wonder this country is in crisis and sometimes uses dirty tricks because it is overpowered by Russia. Citizens suffered traumas and Soviet mentality, and brutal city designs did not help at all. Human rights are not protected enough, and political and socio-technical brainwashing is present. Human trafficking is the most profitable business, not only for cheap labor but often for prostitution.

From 2015, Ukraine decreased in population from around 45 million to around 38 and is the biggest immigrant group in the European Union: more than 2.5 million people. According to Wikipedia, multinational aid spending was $380 billion, which means more than $800 thousand for a citizen. It was mostly pricy military equipment that could not be sold elsewhere, but on the other hand, Ukrainian people just wanted to get money, not more war; a few thousand a person would be enough.

Another example of a wartime system is communist North Korea. Compulsory military for everyone. Military women tend to perform a big role in the system, fulfilling “best girl” marches and stands. North Korea has the largest army in the world; the population includes teenage paramilitary. One of the most closed societies in the world. Despite the small amount of controlled foreigners like English teachers, there was no big traffic. Surveillance state with much control.

Despite the USA being the top producer of weapons, Russia takes the extra place on the podium mainly because of its post-Soviet military mentality and recent situations with Ukraine. What is special about the country is its thief culture and recruiting military from that particular pool. Russia has a deep military culture from the clothing industry, music, and military values to education that also enters the military. High status in society and sometimes no other career paths in the country is enough for Russia to be a military regime. For many, Russia is a well-known fact: prospering weapons factories, high industrialization, and petroleum foreign affairs. Able to switch economies for a war regime faster than slower.

According to Google, “the reign of terror wrought upon innocent civilians by Mexico’s drug cartels accounted for 23,000 fatalities in 2016, according to IISS’s study of ongoing conflicts around the world. That’s compared with around 16,000 deaths in Iraq and 17,000 in Afghanistan." Mexico is also known for deep-dark rituals in rural areas. Mexicans also tend to militarize part of their young population.

A country with currency problems. Many young people are in military careers.

## Words of finish

Every country has a military, and having a good army to protect seems like one of the most important things for stability and growth. There are many good examples, but bad examples are noisier and often will outstand public conscience. Hopefully in the future good globalism will happen concerning more mature humanity and more and more controlled violence outbursts that will be treated professionally by international communities like NATO, ONZ, or maybe a new form of governance.
